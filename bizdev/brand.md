# What's my brand?

## Purpose

**Why does my business exist?**

Buckets exists because existing budgeting offerings are too expensive, too privacy-invasive and not flexible enough for what I want to do.

Because we like budgeting and we ... why does it exist?  And we hope other people like budgeting, too.  And we want to make money.

**What mission is my business attempting to accomplish?**

Buckets wants to provide private, beautiful budgeting that you'll stick with to pull yourself out of debt and toward achieving financial goals you didn't think were in reach.

Facilitate people using their money wisely.  And keep track of their money.

- Exceptional, human support

- Fun

- It's private.
- I feel like it's simpler than others, but I haven't tried.
- It's simple and straightforward
- It's easy to use.


**What makes my service or product better or unique?**
