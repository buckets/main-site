## What limitations does the trial version have?

The trial version of Buckets includes a little yellow sticker in the bottom left side of the window and after a while, will periodically remind you to buy the full version.  Otherwise, it is identical to the full version.


## Is there a mobile app?

No, not yet.  There are no immediate plans for a mobile version of Buckets, but I'm not opposed to eventually making one.
