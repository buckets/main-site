Here are some guiding principles to help you budget well.  *How* to do each of these is explored in more detail in this guide.

## Give Generously

Your life will be better when you give some amount of money away.  It doesn't have to be much, but build charitable giving *into* your budget.

## Live on Last Month's Income

Ideally, you should live on last month's income.  If you're not able to do it yet, make it a goal.  You can do it!

## Get Out of Debt

## Build a Supply

Make a goal to save up a month's supply of income.  Then make it two months.  Then three.  All the way up to 12.

## Tools Are Just Tools

Hammers don't build houses.  People do.

No one says: "look at the beautiful house this hammer built!"  Likewise, budgeting tools don't make you better with money&mdash;you do.

Don't tell anyone I told you this, but you could successfully budget *without Buckets.*  You could use a spreadsheet.  Or a calculator and notebook.  Prior generations used paper and pencils.  Bust out a slide rule or abacus if you want.  These are all just tools.

Budgeting tools can be good for:

- math
- automating tedious things
- presenting potentially hidden information
- reminding

Budgeting tools are not good at:

- earning money
- saving money
- putting that candy bar back at the grocery store checkout

Tools are just tools.  Effective budgeting is all about **you.**
