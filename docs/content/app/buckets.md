After entering our accounts, we clicked on the **Buckets** tab to divide up our money into useful categories&mdash;buckets.  It's useful to think of buckets as literal buckets, filled with money, sitting around your house (or pretend their envelopes, if you prefer).

We make a bucket for every independent expense or goal.  We currently have 63 buckets, but we didn't start with that many.  Don't feel pressured to make a bunch.  Here's a sampling of our buckets:

- Food
- Mortgage
- Diapers
- Year's supply
- Haircuts
- Charity
- Car repairs
- Car insurance
- Car registration
- Gas
- Vacation
- Parties
- Matt spending
- Clothing
- Clothing for kids
- Redo wood floors
- Costco membership
