The very first thing we did when setting up our budget was to enter all our bank account names and balances in the **Accounts** tab.

Each account has a detailed view that you can get to by clicking *more*.


## Naming accounts

To name/rename an account, click on it's name in the table (or in the detailed view) and type in the new name.


## Balance

In the account's detailed view, change the balance by updating the value in the balance text box.


## Closing accounts

If you close a bank account (in real life) you can record the account as closed in Buckets by clicking the *Close* button at the bottom of the account's detailed view.

Closed accounts are hidden in certain places, but all existing transactions will be preserved.

## Deleting accounts

<warning>Deleting accounts can really mess up your budget because all transactions associated with the account are also deleted.  Be careful with deleting accounts.</warning>

If you want to delete an account *and* all its transactions, first close it, then click the **Delete** button.
