Every real life transaction for your accounts should cause a corresponding transaction in one or more Buckets.  So if you charged $1 to your credit card to buy a doughnut, you should take $1 out of your *Doughnut* bucket.

Also, if you don't have one already, perhaps you should make a *Doughnut* bucket :)

Categorizing happens in the **Transactions** tab.

## Simple categorizing

1. Click *Categorize* on a transaction
2. Choose a bucket from the dropdown menu.
3. Click *Save*

![Single category](../categorizing_img/single_cat.png)

This creates a transaction on the bucket for the same amount as the real life transaction.

## Multiple buckets

1. Click *Categorize*
2. Choose a bucket from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on the amount next to the chosen bucket, and change it.
4. Choose another bucket from the dropdown menu that appears.
5. Click *Save*

![Multiple categories](../categorizing_img/multiple_cat.png)

This splits the amount from the real life transaction between the chosen buckets.

## Income

If a transaction is income (e.g. your paycheck), instead of categorizing it for a particular bucket, click the *Income* button.  Doing this adds that amount to your *Rain* for the month.

## Transfer

If you transfer money between 2 accounts, you should categorize both transactions as *Transfers*.

For instance, if you transfer $100 from Savings and put it into Checking, you'll have two transactions:

- -$100 from Savings
- +$100 into Checking

Categorize both of those as *Transfers* and then your income won't be artificially inflated.
