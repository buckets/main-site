If you are trying to pay off debt, there are a few things Buckets can offer you.

## Mortgage/Loan

Many users treat fixed-payment credit (e.g. mortgages and car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget.  It makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as *Off Budget* rather than *Debt*.

## Credit Cards and Other Debt

If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a *Normal* account.

If, however, you are trying to pay off a credit card balance, it may be helpful to mark the account as *Debt*.

## Debt Accounts

Changing an account to a *Debt* account causes two things to happen:

1. The account's negative balance is removed from your total rain.
2. A debt payment bucket is automatically created.

### 1. Rain without Debt

Suppose you have the following account balances:

| Account | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Credit Card | -3,000 |
| Checking | 2,000 |
| **Total** | **-1,000** |

If your Credit Card account is a normal account, in order to get your Rain to 0, your bucket balances will have to total to -1,000 also.  For example:

| Bucket | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Food | -250 |
| Rent | -500 |
| Clothing | -250 |
| **Total** | **-1,000** |

Budgeting with a bunch of negative amounts doesn't match reality, though.  In real life, you would never allocate a negative amount for food.  So, when you mark an account as *Debt* it removes that debt from your rain amount so that you can budget like this:

| Bucket | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Food | 750 |
| Rent | 1,000 |
| Clothing | 250 |
| **Total** | **2,000** |

### 2. Debt Payment Bucket

The debt payment bucket will mirror every transaction into your account.  For instance:

- if you deposit $50 into your debt account, the payment bucket balance will decrease by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone down.
- if you withdraw $50 from your debt account, the payment bucket balance will increase by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone up.

You are also welcome to put additional funds into the debt payment bucket as you have them.

<warning>Because of complicated deadlines associated with credit card billing, don't assume that the amount in the payment bucket is the exact amount you should pay.</warning>

## Another Great Idea

You'll have more success paying off your debt if you budget for it.  Consider these two ideas:

1. Create an *additional* recurring expense bucket and choose an amount to pay toward your debt every month.  After making it rain each month, transfer the balance to the debt payment bucket.
2. After making it rain each month, put any extra money into the debt payment bucket.
