If you are trying to pay off debt, there are a few things Buckets can offer you.

## Mortgage/Loan

Many users treat mortgages and long term loans (such as car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget.  So it makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as "Off Budget."

## Credit Cards and Other Debt

If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a normal "On Budget" account.

If, however, you are trying to pay off a credit card balance, it may be helpful to mark the account as "In Debt."

## "In Debt" Accounts

Marking an account as "In Debt" causes two things to happen:

1. The account's negative balance is removed from your total rain.
2. A special payment bucket is created.

### 1. Rain without Debt

Suppose you have the following account balances:

| Account | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Credit Card | -3,000 |
| Checking | 2,000 |
| **Total** | **-1,000** |

If your Credit Card account is a normal account, in order to get your Rain to 0, your bucket balances will have to total to -1,000 also.  For example:

| Bucket | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Food | -250 |
| Rent | -500 |
| Clothing | -250 |
| **Total** | **-1,000** |

Budgeting with a bunch of negative amounts doesn't match reality, though.  In real life, you would never allocate a negative amount for food.  So, when you mark an account as "In Debt" it removes that debt from your rain amount so that you can budget like this:

| Bucket | Balance |
|---|--:|
| Food | 750 |
| Rent | 1,000 |
| Clothing | 250 |
| **Total** | **2,000** |

### 2. Special Payment Bucket
