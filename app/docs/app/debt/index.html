<h1>Debt</h1>



<p>If you are trying to pay off debt, there are a few things Buckets can offer you.</p>

<h2 id="mortgage-loan">Mortgage/Loan</h2>

<p>Many users treat fixed-payment credit (e.g. mortgages and car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget.  It makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as <em>Off budget</em> rather than <em>Debt</em>.</p>

<h2 id="credit-cards-and-other-debt">Credit Cards and Other Debt</h2>

<p>If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a <em>Normal</em> account.</p>

<p>If, however, you are trying to pay off a credit card balance, it may be helpful to mark the account as <em>Debt</em>.</p>

<h2 id="debt-accounts">Debt Accounts</h2>

<p>Changing an account to a <em>Debt</em> account causes two things to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The account&rsquo;s negative balance is removed from your total rain.</li>
<li>A special payment bucket is created.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-rain-without-debt">1. Rain without Debt</h3>

<p>Suppose you have the following account balances:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Account</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Credit Card</td>
<td align="right">-3,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Checking</td>
<td align="right">2,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>-1,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If your Credit Card account is a normal account, in order to get your Rain to 0, your bucket balances will have to total to -1,000 also.  For example:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bucket</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Food</td>
<td align="right">-250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rent</td>
<td align="right">-500</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Clothing</td>
<td align="right">-250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>-1,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Budgeting with a bunch of negative amounts doesn&rsquo;t match reality, though.  In real life, you would never allocate a negative amount for food.  So, when you mark an account as <em>Debt</em> it removes that debt from your rain amount so that you can budget like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bucket</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Food</td>
<td align="right">750</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rent</td>
<td align="right">1,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Clothing</td>
<td align="right">250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>2,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="2-special-payment-bucket">2. Special Payment Bucket</h3>

<p>The special payment bucket will mirror every transaction into your account.  For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you deposit $50 into your debt account, the payment bucket balance will decrease by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone down.</li>
<li>if you withdraw $50 from your debt account, the payment bucket balance will increase by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone up.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also welcome to put additional funds into the payment bucket as you have them.</p>

<p><warning>Because of complicated deadlines associated with credit card billing, don&rsquo;t assume that the amount in the payment bucket is the exact amount you should pay.</warning></p>
