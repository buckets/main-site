<h1>Debt</h1>



<p>If you are trying to pay off debt, there are a few things Buckets can offer you.</p>

<h2 id="mortgage-loan">Mortgage/Loan</h2>

<p>Many users treat fixed-payment credit (e.g. mortgages and car loans) as expenses to the budget rather than accounts within the budget.  It makes sense to mark these kinds of debt accounts as <strong>Off Budget</strong> rather than <strong>Debt</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="credit-cards-and-other-debt">Credit Cards and Other Debt</h2>

<p>If you always pay off your credit card in full every statement, then you are safe to leave your credit card account as a <strong>Normal</strong> account.</p>

<p>If, however, you are trying to pay off a credit card balance, it may be helpful to mark the account as <strong>Debt</strong>.  Click the account details and change the account type from <strong>Normal</strong> to <strong>Debt</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="debt-accounts">Debt Accounts</h2>

<p>Changing an account to a <strong>Debt</strong> account causes two things to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The account&rsquo;s negative balance is removed from your total rain.</li>
<li>A debt payment bucket is automatically created.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-rain-without-debt">1. Rain without Debt</h3>

<p>Suppose you have the following account balances:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Account</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Credit Card</td>
<td align="right">-3,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Checking</td>
<td align="right">2,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>-1,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If your Credit Card account is a normal account, in order to get your Rain to 0, your bucket balances will have to total to -1,000 also.  For example:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bucket</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Food</td>
<td align="right">-250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rent</td>
<td align="right">-500</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Clothing</td>
<td align="right">-250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>-1,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Budgeting with a bunch of negative amounts doesn&rsquo;t match reality, though.  In real life, you would never allocate a negative amount for food.  So, when you mark an account as <strong>Debt</strong> it removes that debt from your rain amount so that you can budget like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bucket</th>
<th align="right">Balance</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Food</td>
<td align="right">750</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rent</td>
<td align="right">1,000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Clothing</td>
<td align="right">250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td align="right"><strong>2,000</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="2-debt-payment-bucket">2. Debt Payment Bucket</h3>

<p>The debt payment bucket will mirror every transaction into your account.  For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you deposit $50 into your debt account, the payment bucket balance will decrease by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone down.</li>
<li>if you withdraw $50 from your debt account, the payment bucket balance will increase by $50 indicating that your pending payment has gone up.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also welcome to put additional funds into the debt payment bucket as you have them.</p>

<p><warning>Because of complicated deadlines associated with credit card billing, don&rsquo;t assume that the amount in the payment bucket is the exact amount you should pay. See the next section for help with this.</warning></p>

<h2 id="syncing-the-payment-balance-with-the-billing-cycle">Syncing the payment balance with the billing cycle</h2>

<p>Credit cards can have very complicated billing cycles.  And even the simplest cycles can create confusion.  In the simplest case, you&rsquo;ll have one billing cycle&rsquo;s payment due just as the next billing cycle ends, as shown here:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using a <strong>Debt</strong> account, this means that your debt payment bucket can often include money meant for 2 or more cycles at once.  Here are some tips to help ease the confusion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pay off each billing cycle as close to the end date as you can.  This limits the amount of overlap with other cycles.</p></li>

<li><p>The first month you use a <strong>Debt</strong> account, just before you make your first payment, add your payment amount to the debt payment bucket.</p>

<p>For instance, if your debt payment bucket has accumulated $400 and you&rsquo;re about to pay $600 for the previous billing cycle, first add $600 to your debt payment bucket to bring the balance to $1000.  Make your payment and the balance should now reflect the amount due on your next cycle.</p></li>

<li><p>Consult the debt payment bucket&rsquo;s transaction list and use the balance <em>at the end of the previous billing cycle</em> as your payment amount.</p>

<p>For instance, if your billing cycle ends on the 4th of the month, though your bucket might have $690 in it <em>now</em>, at the end of the previous billing cycle it only had $450.  Pay $450 rather than $690.
<img src="../debt_img/btrans_balanceasof.png" alt="Bucket transaction list" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Always double check that the amount you plan to pay matches what you&rsquo;ve been billed.</p>

<h2 id="another-great-idea">Another Great Idea</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll have more success paying off your debt if you budget for it.  Consider these two ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an <em>additional</em> recurring expense bucket and choose an amount to pay toward your debt every month.  After making it rain each month, transfer the balance to the debt payment bucket.</li>
<li>After making it rain each month, put any extra money into the debt payment bucket.</li>
</ol>
