      <description>Saving Almost all changes you make in Buckets automatically save immediately. That&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s no save button. Currently, the only exception to this is when recording macros (because updating macros must be explicitly saved).
Calculators Everywhere! Somewhat like a spreadsheet, every field in Buckets where you type in numbers is a calculator. For instance, you can type 2+2 or 35/12:
Notes Accounts, transactions, buckets and bucket groups can all have searchable notes attached to them.</description>

      <description>The very first thing we did when setting up our budget was to enter all our bank account names and balances in the Accounts tab.
Each account has a detailed view that you can get to by clicking more.
Naming accounts To name/rename an account, click on it&amp;rsquo;s name in the table (or in the detailed view) and type in the new name.
Balance In the account&amp;rsquo;s detailed view, change the balance by updating the value in the balance text box.</description>

      <description>Every real life transaction for your accounts should cause a corresponding transaction in one or more Buckets. So if you charged $1 to your credit card to buy a doughnut, you should take $1 out of your Doughnut bucket.
Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one already, perhaps you should make a Doughnut bucket :)
Categorizing happens in the Transactions tab.
Simple categorizing  Click Categorize on a transaction Choose a bucket from the dropdown menu.</description>
