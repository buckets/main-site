      <description>Saving Almost all changes you make in Buckets automatically save immediately. That&amp;rsquo;s why there&amp;rsquo;s no save button. Currently, the only exception to this is when recording macros (because updating macros must be explicitly saved).
Calculators Everywhere! Somewhat like a spreadsheet, every field in Buckets where you type in numbers is a calculator. For instance, you can type 2+2 or 35/12:
Notes Accounts, transactions, buckets and bucket groups can all have searchable notes attached to them.</description>

      <description>The very first thing we did when setting up our budget was to enter all our bank account names and balances in the Accounts tab.
Each account has a detailed view that you can get to by clicking more.
Naming accounts To name/rename an account, click on it&amp;rsquo;s name in the table (or in the detailed view) and type in the new name.
Balance In the account&amp;rsquo;s detailed view, change the balance by updating the value in the balance text box.</description>

      <description>Every real life transaction for your accounts should cause a corresponding transaction in one or more Buckets. So if you charged $1 to your credit card to buy a doughnut, you should take $1 out of your Doughnut bucket.
Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one already, perhaps you should make a Doughnut bucket :)
Categorizing happens in the Transactions tab.
Simple categorizing  Click Categorize on a transaction Choose a bucket from the dropdown menu.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This article is intended for programmers who want to write programs that interface with budget files. You don&amp;rsquo;t need this if you just want to use the Buckets app. 
Buckets budget files are SQLite databases. The schema is mostly self-explanatory, but this document points out some things that aren&amp;rsquo;t.
 WARNING: The schema is not final and may change without warning in future versions of Buckets.</description>

      <description>The Buckets method is a variation of what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Envelope Budgeting.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t invent this method. I don&amp;rsquo;t even consider it an invented thing. It just seems like a logical thing to do with money. You could do this with physical envelopes or the Buckets app.
Steps In essence, you do this every month:
 Get a bucket Make it rain! Use it up Adjust  Here&amp;rsquo;s each step in more detail.</description>

      <description>Here are some guiding principles to help you budget well. How to do each of these is explored in more detail in other pages in this guide.
Give generously Your life will be better when you give some amount of money away. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be much, but build charitable giving into your budget.
Live on last month&amp;rsquo;s income Spend this month what you earned last month. If you&amp;rsquo;re not able to do it yet, make it a goal.</description>
