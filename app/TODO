MAKE SURE YOU ADD TO changes/{type}-{name}.md

Bugs:
 ☐ Have the open/new dialog menus open to a good default location instead of /
 ☐ Turning a regular expense back to a normal bucket retains the deposit in rain
 ☐ Preferences page doesn't have the right language.

v1.0.0:
 ☐ Timeout syncing (like if there's no internet connection)
 ☐ Bug: Why do account balances get out of sync so often?
 ☐ Sign the code
 ☐ Encryption: http://atom.github.io/node-keytar/
 ☐ Encrypt simplefin connection stuff
 ☐ Remove "Test Toast" button :)
 ☐ Prompt to be added to newsletter
 ☐ Record signing in to bank (with encryption)
 ☐ Accessibility: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA

Videos:
  ☐ "Doing" the budget (categorize, make it rain, adjust)
  ☐ Entering transactions
    ☐ SimpleFIN
    ☐ Manually
    ☐ File import
  ☐ Going into debt to yourself

Backlog:
 ☐ When categorizing, it would be nice to be able to create a new bucket sometimes.
 ☐ Align the warning triangle on account balance mismatch.
 ☐ When you create a new bucket, focus on that new bucket
 ☐ When you create a new account, focus on that new account
 ☐ Up/Down in bucket transact should go to the next/prev transact input
 ☐ Import CSV
 ☐ Export CSV
 ☐ Automatically sync so the users don't have to
 ☐ Delete (retire) accounts
 ☐ Show only debt buckets filter
 ☐ Add a pop up calculator
   ☐ Should it be a separate window or built in to the screen?
 ☐ Alert that there's uncategorized transactions in previous months.
 ☐ I think this warning happens when a Money is animating and then disappears. Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the Money component.
 ☐ Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the Categorizer component.
