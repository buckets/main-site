Need:
 ☐ Format categorizing thing better
   ☐ When you click to categorize, focus on the first dropdown
 ☐ There needs to be a way to submit bugs
 ☐ There needs to be a way to submit log files
 ☐ Allow for goals with no deposit amount.
 

Want:
 ☐ Import OFX
 ☐ Delete groups
 ☐ When you create a new bucket, focus on that new bucket
 ☐ When you create a new account, focus on that new account
 ☐ Up/Down in bucket transact should go to the next/prev transact input
 ☐ Import CSV
 ☐ Just make routing.tsx global instead of using react's context system
   ☐ And make it so that you don't have to render in order to get the year/month
   ☐ Or redirect.
 ☐ Delete accounts
 ☐ Show only debt buckets
 ☐ Show Income/expenses average over the last 3 months
 ☐ A pop up calculator
 ☐ Alert that there's uncategorized transactions in previous months.
 ☐ I think this warning happens when a Money is animating and then disappears. Warning: setState(...): Can only update a mounted or mounting component. This usually means you called setState() on an unmounted component. This is a no-op. Please check the code for the Money component.
