Need:
 ☐ Ability to delete transactions in UI
 ☐ DRM
 ☐ Delete groups
 ☐ Make sure simplefin sync always goes back far enough
 ☐ There needs to be a way to submit bugs
 ☐ There needs to be a way to submit log files
 ☐ Format categorizing thing better
 ☐ Make it rain

Want:
 ☐ Import OFX
 ☐ When you create a new bucket, focus on that new bucket
 ☐ When you create a new account, focus on that new account
 ☐ Up/Down in bucket transact should go to the next/prev transact input
 ☐ Import CSV
 ☐ Just make routing.tsx global instead of using react's context system
   ☐ And make it so that you don't have to render in order to get the year/month
   ☐ Or redirect.

 ☐ Show only debt buckets
 ☐ Show Income/expenses average over the last 3 months
