The Buckets tab is cleaner (less busy) through the following changes.  The balance of each bucket is now the first number.  "Out" and "Transfer" columns have been combined into a single "Activity" column.  When there is an amount in the "In/Out" field, the current and future balance no longer make the table expand horizontally. The heading labels are repeated for each bucket group.
